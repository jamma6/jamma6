# Welcome to the README page for Mr. Guerrero!

## About Me
I teach at North-Grand High School in Chicago, IL.  I was born and raised in Chicago, and have lived here most of my life.  I studied Physics and Mathematics in College, and as a teacher I spent the first several years teaching only Math and Science - and the only reason I started teaching Computer Science is because I was endorsed in Chemistry, I was forced to teach Chemistry, and I ehated it so much I had to get out... and my only avenue of escape was into Computer Science!  Best disaster of my life, because I love it!

If you wish to contact me, my email is: nrguerrero@cps.edu



I've always loved programming (as I child someone once gifted me a BASIC mini-computer that connected through the TV), but I only did coding very sparsely. But through teaching it to others, I have grown massively, and constantly have chance to use my skills to help further their skills.
